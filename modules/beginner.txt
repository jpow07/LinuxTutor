    - Linux Man Pages                   [$ man {Program Name}   ]

Linux Tutor will provide a 'Command' and a brief description of the command. Keep in mind some commands require a lengthy explination; however, it will be much faster to read than it will be to search for it online, or you can ignore it completely and just type the command to see what it does.

Instructions:

You will type the 'command' into the Terminal prompt, where the terminal will execute the command.

If at anytime you want to try the command again simply type 'Refresh {command}' and it will move you back to that point in the tutorial.

Before we get started there are a couple of things to remember. The terminal is case sensitive. So 'L' is not 'l' and 'LinuxTutor' is not the same as 'linuxtutor'.

Alright, Let's Begin!
