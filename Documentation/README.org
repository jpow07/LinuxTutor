* HTML PREVIEW
  I have exported all my documentations notes to HTML. To preview the documentation go to:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  htmlpreview.github.com
  #+END_SRC

  Copy the url address where the documentation you are trying to view is located and paste it into the bar. This will preview the documentation.
