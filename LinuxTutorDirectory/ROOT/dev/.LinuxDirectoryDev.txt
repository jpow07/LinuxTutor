Welcome to the dev Directory!

The dev directory holds Essential device files. Device files are interfaces
for your computers hardware. These files are used to control how each hardware
device will operate in your computer.

To learn more about device files go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file

Now we will learn about pwd, cat and grep, echo and more operators

+--------------+
|$ pwd         |
+--------------+

pwd is a command that prints the working directory, or in lamens terms
it tells you what directory your in. This can be helpful at times but
its usually written on the command line before the $ sign

+-----------------+
|$ cat [filename] |
+-----------------+

cat with a filename will print out the contents of the file to the terminal.
Remember that Linux is case-sensitive so you must type it exactly as you see it.

I have included a file that you can output the the terminal.

+-----------------+
|$ grep [keyword] |
+-----------------+

grep searches a file for words or regular epressions

NOTE: grep must be used in conjunction with other commands and is linked with
the pipe command ( | ).

+-------------------------------+
|$ cat file1.txt | grep "hello" |
+-------------------------------+

echo is a command that prints a message to the terminal

+----------------------+
|$ echo "Hello World"  |
+----------------------+

echo can also be used in conjunction with operators <, <<
The > operator will overwrite the file adding your new text
Whereas the >> operator will append your message to the end
of the specified file

+------------------------------------+
|$ echo  "Hello World" > [filename]  |
+------------------------------------+

the operators must be used in conjunction with a filename.
Note: if the filename doesnt exist or if you misspell or forget
a capital letter the terminal will create a file and add the string of
text to the file. Typically output files have a .txt extension.


+------------------------------------+
|$ echo "Hello World" >> [filename]  |
+------------------------------------+

give these both a try and also make up your own file name then
call the cat command on it to view your text.

+-----------------------------------+
|$ echo "Hello World" > output.txt  |
+-----------------------------------+

After you have completed those tasks move to the next directory

+--------------------------+
|$ cd ../etc && LinuxTutor |
+--------------------------+
