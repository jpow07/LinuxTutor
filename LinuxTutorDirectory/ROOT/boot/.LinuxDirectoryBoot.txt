Welcome to the boot Directory!

The boot directory contains bootloader files, kernels, and init files.
These files are loaded when you turn on your comptuer.

To learn more about Bootloaders go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#BOOT-LOADER
To learn more about the Kernel go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)

Now we will learn about clear, Man Pages and operators:

By now your terminal is filled with text, to clear out all the text
run the clear command.

+--------------+
|$ clear       |
+--------------+

Remember: that once you clear the terminal you will have to run
LinuxTutor agian to view this file.
 
+--------------+
|$ LinuxTutor  |
+--------------+

Man Pages are documentation for the programs on your computer. They can be
helpful when trying to figure out how a program works.

To view Man Pages you simply type:

+--------------+
|$ man ls      |
+--------------+

This will pull up the entire manual covering the ls command.
Note: Not every program will have a man page, so you could get an
error stating : No Manual Entry for [Program name]

Operators are used in conjunction with other programs

We have been using the and operator(&&) which essentially runs the first program
then it runs the second program. It is equivilent to running the two programs
separately.

+----------------------------------------+
|$ cd path/to/directory && LinuxTutor    |
+----------------------------------------+

path/to/directory is not a valid directory, but rather a way to express some
directory on the system. You will typically see this written on common troubleshooting sites
such as stackoverflow.
It simply means replace with path/to/directory with a valid path such as ../bin

Another useful operator to keep in mind is the pipe operator ( | )

The pipe operator will take the output of one program and use it as the input for another program.
We will learn more about this later.

Once you have viewed a couple man pages lets move to the next directory.

+-----------------------------+
|$ cd ../dev && LinuxTutor    |
+-----------------------------+
