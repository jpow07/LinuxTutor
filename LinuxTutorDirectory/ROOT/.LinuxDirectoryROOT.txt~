Welcome to the Linux Tutor Directory!

Here you will find a collection of folders meant to represent the linux file system. We can navigate these folders, change permissions, documents and even delete things without worrying that we will mess something up.

To visualize the linux file system try to imagine a factor tree. At the top of the factor tree is the root directory, the root directory holds every other directory on the system.

Contained within the root directory are the following:

bin   - This folder holds your computers binary files, files that have been compiled down into code the computer hardware cana understand
boot  - This folder holds your computers bootloader, these files tell your computer how it should start up when you turn it on
dev   - This folder holds your device drivers, these programs control each specific piece of hardware, Note: each piece of hardware requires unique software in order to function properly
etc   - This folder is the Etcetra folder, it holds User config files
home  - This folder holds all your User specific files, like your Desktop, Documents, Pictures, etc
lib   - This folder holds library files
media - This folder stores external storage devices, for example if you plug a USB into your computer and you want to get some files off of it, this is where you go to do that
mnt   - This folder is for external devices, For example...
opt   - This folder is the optional file and it stores unessentail programs that you the user have installed.
proc  - This folder is the process file system and is responsible for
root  - This folder is the root user folder, not to be mistaken for the root folder mentioned earlier
sbin  - This folder holds your system files
srv   - This folder holds your service files
tmp   - This folder holds temporary files,that are cleared out after a specified time, typically on shut down
usr   - This folder holds your application files   
var   - This folder stores files that are subject to frequent changes

to learn more about each file system simply move to that directory but before you do that you might need a little help getting back.

We have already learned how to move into directories but how do we move back to the previous directory?

To move up a directory you will type "cd .." this will move you to the parent directory, or to the folder you just came from.

Now go ahead and move to the bin directory.

"cd bin"
