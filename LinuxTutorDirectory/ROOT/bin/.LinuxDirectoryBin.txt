Welcome to the bin directory!

Here is where your computers Essential binary files.
Binaries are executable programs that have been compiled
down to machine code.

Now we will learn more about the ls command

+--------------------+
|$ ls                |
+--------------------+

ls comes with options, options allow the program to be more dynamic.

The list command has many options and all these options can be viewed by
typeing:

+--------------------+
|$ ls --help         |
+--------------------+

--help is an option that brings up all the other options ls offers

A couple more options:


+--------------------+
|$ ls --all          |
+--------------------+

--all will show all files and directories within the current directory.
This is useful for view dotfiles. dotfiles are hiddenfiles on the system.
Note: some commands offer a shorthand notation so -a will do the same thing
as --all. Its a typical convention that shorthand have one - prior and
full commands have two -- before.


+--------------------+
|$ ls -l             |
+--------------------+

-l will show you all the current files and their permissions. Dont worry about
understanding permissions we will cover that later.

You can also combine options, but be careful because some programs like the
GNU compiler doesn't allow this feature. But most programs do.

+--------------------+
|$ ls -al            |
+--------------------+

-al will list all the files and subdirectories along with their permissions.

Once you have tried all of these features you can change to the next directory
and run the LinuxTutor

+---------------------------+
|$ cd ../boot && LinuxTutor |
+---------------------------+

Note: you can move up a directory and into another directory all in one command.
A combination of directories is called a Path. The Path must be exact, as it cannot
jump over other folders. Think of a Path as a road, you cannot get from one end of town
to the other without following the roads. The roads in this case are directories.
