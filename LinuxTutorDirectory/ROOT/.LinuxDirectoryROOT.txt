Welcome to the Linux ROOT Directory!

This is a stripped version of the actual Linux Root system. This is
meant to represent the Linux file system so you can move around
without worrying about messing up your computer.

To visualize the linux file system try to imagine a factor tree.
At the top of the factor tree is the root directory, the root
directory holds every other directory on the system.

Contained within the root directory are the following:

bin       boot       dev      etc
home      lib        media    mnt 
opt       proc       root     sbin
srv       tmp        usr      var

Note: Every system is different but Generally these folders remain constant.

Instructions:

1. Now we will practice moving to and from directories directories

+-------------------------+
|$ cd [folder name]       |
+-------------------------+

cd is shorthand for change directory

[folder name] is an option (More on these later), but usually you will
follow the cd command with a folder.

2. To Move up to the parent directory (The one you just came from), you will execute


+-------------------------+
|$ cd ..                  |
+-------------------------+


.. is the name of the parent directory.

3. Before you take off changing directories, you need to be able to view the
subdirectory. This is done with the ls command.

+-------------------------+
|$ ls                     |
+-------------------------+

ls lists all the subdirectories within the current directory

4. Once you get to the next subdirectory run the LinuxTutor program

+-------------------------+
|$ LinuxTutor             |
+-------------------------+

NOTE: As you visit each Linux subdirectory you will encounter a new command.
Just keep in mind these commands are not specific to the folder you're in, but
rather a way to practice new commands without getting overwhelmed.
