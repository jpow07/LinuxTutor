                 Welcome to LinuxTutor!

This Program will help you familiarize yourself with some basic
commands that you will need to navigate your way around the file
system.

This program is intended to help an Absolute Linux NOOB, navigate
their way around the linux terminal without having to do a bunch of
internet searches.

This program will help you navigate the file system, edit documents,
as well as learn some basic terminal commands.

This Tutorial will take it one step at a time.

Most of the instructions will not be as long as this one, so don't get
intimidated.

Instructions:

The Linux Terminal is case sensitive which means that dog is not the
same as Dog. Something to keep in your mind at all times.

Anytime there is a command to be entered, it will be surrounded by a
box.

For Example:

+----------------------------+
|$ command arg1 arg2 ..      |
+----------------------------+

The $ indicates the command prompt and should not be typed into the
command bar. It's sole purpose is to let you know you will be working
within the terminal.

Also, Below the box will be a description of all the keywords used.

If at any time you forget what you're supposed to be doing you may
simply scroll up in the terminal and refer back to these notes.
However, the terminal will cut off text files if they are too long in
which case you can simply run the LinuxTutor command again.

Lesson 1:

To Begin we will install a program, specifically a powerful text
editor, called vim onto your machine.

To install a program we give it the command:

+----------------------------+
|$ sudo apt-get install vim  |
+----------------------------+

sudo : is shorthand for "super user do" which allows the user to execute
programs as root user. You will prefix sudo at the beginning of line
when you need permission to do something and the terminal says
permission denied.

apt-get : allows you to get things from the Advanced Packaging
Tool(apt).

install : lets you install the package

vim : is a package, if you wanted to install another program such as
emacs you would simply replace vim with emacs.

1. Once vim is installed go through vimtutor
2. After completing the vimtutor a couple times we are going to change
directories and run LinuxTutor again, dont worry I will explain cd further when we get to the
next directory.


1. +--------------------+
   |$ vimtutor          |
   +--------------------+

2. +-------------------------+
   |$ cd ROOT && LinuxTutor  |
   +-------------------------+

Note: remember that Linux is case sensitive so ROOT must all be capital.
