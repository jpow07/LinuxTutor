Congratulations on learning Vim, it will take a while to master it though, I recommend executing vimtutor and running through it before every terminal session until it becomes second nature.

Now we will start moving through the directories, also refferred to as folders in a GUI (Graphical User Interface).

To move from one directory to another simply using the change directory commmand or cd

In the command prompt type "cd LinuxTutorDirectory"
